## Installation

-   All you need to run this repo is to install Live Server as a VS Code plugin (if you are using VS Code). Any other local HTTP servier will do.

-   Navigate to the localhost, your sketch will render there.

-   Edit `sketch.js` to noodle around

## Example

- Provide three images to the algorithm. It will iterate over the images and pick a color at a given coordinate. I've added some probabilty to not pick the third image as often, this way, you can add an image with bright colors that match the colors of the other two images.
